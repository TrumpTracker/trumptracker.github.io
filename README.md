# Trump Tracker
Open source for http://trumptracker.github.io/

# To Do List
1. Add Spanish Version
2. Cleaner way to add and handle policies (not hardcode it...)
3. Fuzzy Search functionality for policies
4. Comment section -- Disqus Integration (might be too toxic)
5. Sign up for weekly/ bi-weekly updates.
6. Database for Policies -- top of the agenda
7. ~~Add Open Source Links and Credits on Footer~~
8. Clean up duplicates, if any.
9. Implement functionality to let me click on the "broken", "in progress", "achieved" categories so I can see which things fall into those categories.
10. Rich data so Google can parse it. Maybe something on http://schema.org/?
