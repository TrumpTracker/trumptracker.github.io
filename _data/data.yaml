The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.'

        title: 'Scrap the earlier plan entirely. Here are new tax brackets: Trump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more closely mimic his party''s past views on taxes.'

        description: 'The U.S. cannot support the creation of a new state where terrorism is financially incentivized, terrorists are celebrated by political parties and government institutions, and the corrupt diversion of foreign aid is rampant.

The larger Palestinian society is regularly taught such hatred on Palestinian television, in the Palestinian press, in entertainment media, and in political and religious communications. The two major Palestinian political parties - Hamas and Fatah - regularly promote anti-Semitism and jihad.'
