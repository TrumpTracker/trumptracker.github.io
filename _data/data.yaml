        title: 'Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.'

Here are new tax brackets: Trump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more closely mimic his party''s past views on taxes.'

        title: 'Trump says he''s against violating international laws or ordering others to do so, but wants to change the laws to legalize, at minimum, waterboarding. Trump has said he''s willing to use interrogation techniques that go even further than waterboarding. Even if such tactics don''t work, "they deserve it anyway, for what they''re doing".'

        title: 'The Memorandum of Understanding signed by the American and Israeli Governments is a good first step, but there is much more to be done. A Trump Administration will ensure that Israel receives maximum military, strategic and tactical cooperation from the United States, and the MOU will not limit the support that we give. Further, Congress will not be limited to give support greater than that provided by the MOU if it chooses to do so. Israel and the United States benefit tremendously from what each country brings to the table - the relationship is a two way street.'

Additionally, the Palestinians are divided between PA rule in the West Bank and Hamas rule in Gaza so there is not a united Palestinian people who could control a second state. Hamas is a US-designated terrorist organization that actively seeks Israel''s destruction. We will seek to assist the Israelis and the Palestinians in reaching a comprehensive and lasting peace, to be freely and fairly negotiated between those living in the region.'
